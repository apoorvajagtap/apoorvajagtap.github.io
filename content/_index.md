Hello there, I am Apoorva!

I am a Software Engineer, juggling through technologies during business hours and expressing my thoughts in the off hours.

I am fortunate to encounter multiple production impacted situations on a regular basis, so sharing my experiences, the chaos, and the workarounds here just in case someone else faces the similar. Hope you find it interesting!

*(Disclaimer: I am a story teller :P)*

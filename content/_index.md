Hello there, I am Apoorva!

I am a Software Engineer, juggling through technologies during business hours and expressing my thoughts in the off hours.

I try to learn something new with each day, some days it's a success and some days a failure. But, eventually it adds up to my experiences. So, I am here to share such similar experiences, hoping that someone finds it interesting & helpful!

*(Disclaimer: I am a story teller :P)*

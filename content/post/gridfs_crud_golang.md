<br>Lately, I have been working on building a server that stores and manages files sent by respective client. This was the first time when I had to build a full fledged HTTP server with a compatible database to store files of any size (GBs too).

After reading multiple related blogs, I was able to deduce the following plan for my server:
1. Build HTTP server & respective routes using [*net/http*](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http) package.
2. The server will initiate a connection with [*MongoDB*](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/databases-and-collections/) to perform CRUD operations.
3. But, to bypass the `16 MB` fileSize limit of MongoDB, I had to take the [*GridFS*](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/) feature into consideration. 

Though GridFS eases the management of files, but, GridFS with Go was a learning curve for me. 

While I am writing this, there are really few documentations that could help with all the CRUD operations. Apparently, I did manage to meet the requirements using GridFS with go, and hence, here I am to share my journey.. ðŸ˜‰

âž¤ **What is GridFS ??**

**GridFS** basically is a specification that allows to manage the files with size above 16 MB. As we all must be aware that MongoDB stores data records as "[BSON](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/document/#std-label-bson-document-format) documents" inside a collection.

So, instead of storing the complete file as a single document, which might lead to a document of size above 16MB, GridFS 
- divides the files into parts (termed as `chunks`), 
- and stores each chunk as a seperate document.

In addition to this file's content management, GridFS also takes care of managing the metadata of each file. This is done via two different collections; i.e., [**fs.Chunks**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/#the-chunks-collection) and [**fs.Files**](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/gridfs/#the-files-collection)

Now that we have discussed the basic components I'll be using to build my server, let's move to the next part to dive into the implementations.

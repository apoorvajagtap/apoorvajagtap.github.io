<br>While working with OpenShift end-users, I've observed several instances where the OpenShift cluster has initiated an upgrade to the latest version without the knowledge/interference of the admin. This is most likely to happen when an automatic upgrade option is set to true in CVO's (cluster-version operator) deployment. And it would lead to a real mess if the admin is unaware about this option.
Such events made me curious about CVO's plan of action w.r.t cluster versions, and then I started my research on how CVO keeps the track & manages the cluster's version throughout.   

Fortunately, upstream contributors are really helpful to document such exciting topics, and during my hunt I landed on the documentation maintained by [Cincinnati in OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/cincinnati/blob/master/docs/design/openshift.md#update-process) about update process's desigm.

Here's a flow chart that could help to understand the complete flow of CVO quickly (ref: [Cincinnati in OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/cincinnati/blob/master/docs/design/openshift.md#update-process)).

<br>The above helps us to understand the sequence of events, but what about the time duration for which CVO sleeps/waits before checking for next update-graph? To find answer of this, I took a dive into the [codebase](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/cmd/start.go).

<br>➤ **CVO sleeps for a set duration of time**

With the start of CVO container, we initialize the controllers and attempt to load the payload information using [NewControllerContext()](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/pkg/start/start.go#L432). The `NewControllerContext()` initializes the default context and while doing so, it passes `resyncPeriod(o.ResyncInterval)()` as the [**minimumUpdateCheckInterval**](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/pkg/cvo/cvo.go#L192) (i.e. the minimum duration to check for updates from the upstream).  

The value of `resyncPeriod(o.ResyncInterval)()` is determined using a constant [**minResyncPeriod**](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/pkg/start/start.go#L47), which is set to '2 Minutes'.

So, by default, the minimun reconcile period for CVO is **2 minutes**.

<br>Now, the next question that pops up is how CVO confirms whether the auto-upgrade is enabled or not?

➤ **CVO checks for auto-update**

The **`--enable-auto-update`** option if set to **`true`** enables the `autoupdate controller` and, hence informs CVO that the auto-update is enabled. This option is basically specified as a container argument in `deployment.apps/cluster-version-operator`.

<br>I hope this blog helps you with a better understanding of OpenShift's Cluster version Operator's role during the update process.

<!-- 
The **`--enable-auto-update`** option set to **`true`** does the magic of allowing cluster-version operator to check for available versions and update to the newest version of the respective channel, periodically.

FROM THE CVO LOGS ():
I1007 18:34:28.656423       1 cvo.go:331] Starting ClusterVersionOperator with minimum reconcile period 2m50.956499648s
>> ref: https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/pkg/cvo/cvo.go#L364
Now why the period in logs has nanoseconds too? ans >> https://github.com/openshift/cluster-version-operator/blob/master/pkg/start/start.go#L338-L343

// just to compare two various instances.. (exact nanoseconds)
